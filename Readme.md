#Irdroid WiRF433 - Single Board Linux Computer, Designed by Hardwate Group Ltd.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irdroid WiRF433 is open source software and open source hardware, low cost starting
from USD 38 Linux Industrial grade single board computer with GPIOs capable to operate 
-25 - +85C

The Irdroid WiRF433 SBC is designed with the Ralink RT5350 SoC, 32Mbytes of RAM and 4 Mbytes of Flash.
The Irdroid WiRF433 board is designed with 2 ethernet ports, therefore the board can be 
used for routing. 

All the GPIOs of the RT5350 Soc are available on the WiRF433 board pin headers. The Irdroid WiRF433
comes also with a RF433MHZ RF module which allows for controlling IoT Remote control switches, light bulbs
and sockets operating at 433.9Mhz.

Irdroid WiRF433 is completely open source - including hardware and software, this means you have 
access to all CAD files and sources and you can reuse them for your own personal or commercial project.
There are NO restrictions to manufacture and sell these board for your own use or resale.

###Main Features:
- Mips Architecture CPU @360Mhz
- 32 Mbytes of SDRAM
- 4 Mbyets of FLASH memory
- 1 USB 2.0 HOST Port
- 1-SPI, 1-I2C , and on I2S (AUDIO)
- WiFi 802.11b/g/n interface
- 2 Ethernet interfaces 1WAN and 1LAN
- RF433 RF Remote control interface with onboard Antenna

The Irdroid WiRF433 SBC comes with preinstalled uboot bootloader and OpenWRT Linux distribution, which includes
also IoT remote control applications and software like RCSwitch for controlling RC 433.9Mhz remote control
switches and a Mobile HTML5 web application , configured for work with the RC switches, which gives the possibility to add unlimited number of RCSwitches

###APPLICATIONS:
