Description:  6relayd is a daemon for serving and relaying IPv6 management protocols to
 configure clients and downstream routers.

 6relayd provides server services for RA, stateless DHCPv6, DHCPv6-PD and can
 be used to relay RA, DHCPv6 and NDP between routed (non-bridged) interfaces
 in case no delegated prefixes are provided by the upstream router.
